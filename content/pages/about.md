## What is roadmap.sh?

Roadmap.sh is the place containing community curated roadmaps, study plans, paths and resources for the budding
developers. It started as a [set of charts to guide the developers](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap)
who are confused about what should they learn next but that alone wasn't enough so I expanded it into the website to get
more contributors involved.

## What are the plans for roadmap.sh?

The website started off as
a [simple repository containing a few charts](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap) for developers and
based on my personal opinions but it could have been much more than that so I decided to expand it to a website where
people can contribute to study plans with their areas of expertise as well, add more roadmaps, write guides etc.

We haven't opened up the sign ups for now but we will be doing. My long term plans for this website are to turn it into
a goto place for the developers to seek guidance about their careers, help others, share their journeys, incentivize the
learnings, get feedbacks on their projects etc.

## How did you build roadmap.sh?

The basic version of the website has been built with [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/), is opensource and can
be found on [github](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap). It was hastily done to get it out in front of the
people and get people to start contributing, so it might be rough on the edges, but that is where we need your help.

## How does it make money?

It doesn't make any money. I have been using my personal time and budget to build it. I did not create this website with
any intentions of monetization but as a good will, to help the people get out of the frustration that I was once in.

Having said that, I love teaching and my future plans are to be able to work full-time on roadmap.sh for which it has to
make enough money to pay for my rent, groceries, bills, travel expenses, etc but even if it doesn't it's likely I'll
continue growing the site however I can. My focus at the moment is not making money from it and just adding content that
creates value for the people.
