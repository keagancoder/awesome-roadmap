# Crypto Faucets

A crypto faucet lets users earn small crypto rewards by completing simple tasks. The metaphor is based on how even one drop of water from a leaky faucet could eventually fill up a cup. There are various kinds of crypto faucets, including bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and BNB faucets.

Faucets are common in development environments where developers obtain testnet crypto in order develop and test their application prior to mainnet deployment.
