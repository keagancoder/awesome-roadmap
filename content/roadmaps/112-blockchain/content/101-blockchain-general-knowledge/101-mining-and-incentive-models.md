# Mining and incentive models

Mining is the process of adding transaction details to the Blockchain, like sender address, hash value, etc. The Blockchain contains all the history of the transactions that have taken place in the past for record purposes and it is stored in such a manner that, it canâ€™t be manipulated.

An Incentive is basically a reward given to a Blockchain Miner for speeding up the transactions and making correct decisions while processing the complete transaction securely.
