# Firewall

Firewall is a **network security device** that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization’s previously established security policies. It is a barrier that sits between a private internal network and the public Internet. A firewall’s main purpose is to allow non-threatening traffic in and to keep dangerous traffic out.
