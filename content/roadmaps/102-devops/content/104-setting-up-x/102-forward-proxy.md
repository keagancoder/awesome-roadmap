# Forward Proxy

Forward Proxy, often called proxy server is a server that sits in front of a group of **client machines**. When those computers make requests to sites and services on the Internet, the proxy server intercepts those requests and then communicates with web servers on behalf of those clients, like a middleman.

**Common Uses:**

* To block access to certain content
* To protect client identity online
* To provide restricted internet to organizations
