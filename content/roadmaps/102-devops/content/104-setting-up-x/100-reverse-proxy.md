# Reverse Proxy

A Reverse Proxy server is a type of proxy server that typically sits behind the firewall in a private network and directs client requests to the appropriate backend server. It provides an additional level of security by hiding the server related details like `IP Address` to clients. It is also known as **server side proxy**.

**Common Uses:**

* Load balancing
* Web acceleration
* Security and anonymity
