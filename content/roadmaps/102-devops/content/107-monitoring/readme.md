DevOps monitoring entails overseeing the entire development process from planning, development, integration and testing, deployment, and operations. It involves a complete and real-time view of the status of applications, services, and infrastructure in the production environment. Features such as real-time streaming, historical replay, and visualizations are critical components of application and service monitoring.
