# Port Forwarding

Port forwarding, sometimes called **port mapping**, allows computers or services in private networks to connect over the internet with other public or private computers or services. Since firewalls exist to keep unwanted visitors out, the visitors you want to get in are going to need a way to do so. Knowing the IP address isnâ€™t enough, Requests need to be directed to the correct port as well.
