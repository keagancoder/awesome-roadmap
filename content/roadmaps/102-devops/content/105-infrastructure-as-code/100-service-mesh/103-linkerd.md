# Linkerd

Linkerd is an open source service mesh designed to be deployed into a variety of container schedulers and frameworks such as Kubernetes. It became the original “service mesh” when its creator Buoyant first coined the term in 2016. Like Twitter’s Finagle, on which it was based, Linkerd was first written in Scala and designed to be deployed on a per-host basis. Linkerd is one of the first products to be associated with the term service mesh and supports platforms such as Docker and Kubernetes.
