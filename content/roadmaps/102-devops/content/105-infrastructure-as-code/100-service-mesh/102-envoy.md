# Envoy

Originally created at Lyft, Envoy is a high-performance data plane designed for service mesh architectures. Lyft open sourced it and donated it to the CNCF, where it is now one of the CNCFâ€™s graduated open source projects. Envoy is a self contained process that is designed to run alongside every application server. All of the Envoys form a transparent communication mesh in which each application sends and receives messages to and from localhost and is unaware of the network topology.
