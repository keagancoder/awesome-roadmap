# Service Mesh

A Service Mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer for handling service-to-service communication. Itâ€™s responsible for the reliable delivery of requests through the complex topology of services that comprise a modern, cloud native application. In layman's terms, it's a tool which helps you to control how different services communicate with each other.
