# Python

Python is a multi-paradigm language. Being an interpreted language, code is executed as soon as it is written and the Python syntax allows for writing code in functional, procedural or object-oriented programmatic ways.  Python is frequently recommended as the first language new coders should learn, because of its focus on readability, consistency, and ease of use.  This comes with some downsides, as the language is not especially performant in most production tasks.
