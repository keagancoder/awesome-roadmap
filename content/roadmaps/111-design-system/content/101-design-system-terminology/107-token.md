# Token

Design system tokens are the style values of UI elements such as color, typography, spacing, shadows, etc., that are used across products and capable of being converted to a format for any platform (web, mobile, desktop). Tokens are building blocks of the design systemâ€”think of them as sub atoms, the smallest pieces of style values that allow designers to create styles for a product.
