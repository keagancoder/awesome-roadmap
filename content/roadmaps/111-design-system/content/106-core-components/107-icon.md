# Icon

The icon component is a way to align the way iconography static assets are displayed in the product.

- **Sizes:** Icons should have a number of predefined sizes to provide a holistic experience across the product. Typography pairings may be used for these size values to ensure that they are aligned with the text sizes.
- **Colors:** Icons should be using values from the design system colour palette. Using parent element text colour for icon fill colour can make this automatic.
