# Select

Select lets user select a value from a list of values in a form context:

- **Disabled State:** Prevents input interactions and removes its value from the form submission.
- **Placeholder:** When there’s no value entered, show a placeholder with a potential value example. Don’t use placeholders as labels for the inputs.
- **Label:** There should be a text label linked with the text field. Clicking the label should move the focus to the field.
- **Error State:** The error state is used for form validation errors when the error is related to the text field only. Always use a text error along with changing the colour of the field.
- **Focused State:** The focused state should highlight the text field when users start to interact with it. There is always only one focused field in the form.
- **Autocomplete:** When applicable, adding support for the HTML autocomplete attribute will allow users to easily enter different data types.
- **Icon Support:** Icons are used to describe input methods, express a text field state or provide additional functionality.
