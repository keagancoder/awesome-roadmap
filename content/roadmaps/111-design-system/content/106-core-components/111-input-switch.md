# Input Switch

Input switches toggle the state of a single item. Compared to the input checkbox, their changes usually apply without any additional submission.

- **Checked State:** Used when an input switch is turned on. Itâ€™s better to provide an additional way to indicate the checked state besides changing its colour when applicable.
- **Disabled State:** Prevents interacting with an input switch.
- **Label:** There should be a text label linked with the switch field. Clicking the label should also trigger the input selection.
- **Keyboard State:** A switch selection should be triggered when the Space key is pressed.
