# List

Lists define the layout of the page content or groups of elements stacking them vertically or horizontally.

- **Support any type of content:** Lists can be used in any context from page-level layout to managing offsets between granular components. hey should work with any component used inside.
- **Horizontal Stacking:** Lists can be used for inline elements and they have to manage how theyâ€™re stacked horizontally, including handling offsets between multiple rows of elements.
- **Divided Variant:** Lists with dividers are the best practice advised by many platform guidelines (especially on mobile).
- **Supports Actionable Content:** Sometimes lists are used for grouping tappable components, where the whole area of the list item should be clickable.
