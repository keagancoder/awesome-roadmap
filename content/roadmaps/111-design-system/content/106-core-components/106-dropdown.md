# Dropdown

Dropdowns are used to display a contextual subview with a list of actions or content related to the area where the dropdown is.

- **Supports any type of content:** Dropdowns may be used in a lot of contexts like date pickers, language selection or other product features.
- **Action Menu:** One of the most used scenarios for dropdowns is providing an action menu for the user, so it’s useful to have this layout defined.
- **Focus Trapping:** Once the dropdown’s opened, the focus should work only for elements inside the dropdown. When it’s closed, the focus should move to the dropdown trigger.
- **Close Action:** Either some actions inside the dropdown should close it or there should be a separate close button. Also, it’s good practice to close the dropdown when a user clicks outside.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** It should be possible to navigate through dropdown children elements with the keyboard and close it with an Esc key.
- **Dynamic Position:** Dropdown content should be displayed based on the current position of the trigger element on the screen and always visible to the user.
- **Responsiveness:** Dropdown content should be adapted for mobile viewpoints as it may take a lot of space on desktops.
