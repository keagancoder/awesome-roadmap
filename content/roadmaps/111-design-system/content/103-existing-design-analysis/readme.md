# Existing Design Analysis

First step in creating a design system from an existing design is performing a design analysis and understanding what you will be working with to identify the requirements and prepare a plan. Performing the analysis may consist of:

* Understanding the Existing Design Process
* Performing Visual Audit
* Identifying Design Elements
* Identify Common Components
* Understanding the A/B Testing and Experimentation Needs
* Understanding any Locale or regional requirements (such as LTR/RTL).
* Documenting your findings
