# Existing Design Process

To better understand the kind of design system you would like to implement, you need to start by reviewing and analyzing the current approach for design at your company. Find the answers to the following questions:

* What is the design process that your company follows?
* What are the existing tools that your company uses?

Itâ€™s also recommended to evaluate the level of design maturity of the product teams. This knowledge will help you estimate the time required to introduce the system to your organization.
