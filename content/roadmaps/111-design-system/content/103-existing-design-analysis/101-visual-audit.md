# Visual Audit

Take screenshots of your current product with the help of your team. You can use any presentation software like Google Slides or print and pin them on foam-core boards. Group the screenshots into categories like buttons, navigation, forms, tables, charts, lists etc.

Now, review each category to find inconsistencies and note areas for improvement with your team.  Use a tool like [CSS Stats](https://cssstats.com/) to see how many unique colors, typefaces you have in your style sheets.
