# Functions

A method/function is a way to perform some task. Similarly, in programming like Java, a function method is a block of code written to perform a specific task repeatedly. It provides reusability of code. We write the function once and use it many times. It works on the 'DRY' principle i.e., "Do not repeat yourself".
