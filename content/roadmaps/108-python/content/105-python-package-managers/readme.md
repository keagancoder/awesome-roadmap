# Package Managers

Package managers allow you to manage the dependencies (external code written by you or someone else) that your project needs to work correctly.

`PyPI` and `Pip` are the most common contenders but here are some other options available as well:

 - [**Poetry**](https://python-poetry.org/) : Manages dependencies via isolation
 - [**PIPX**](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) : Isolation-based app deployment, so you don't have to affect the system or user PIP libraries. It enables you to try individual python CLI tools without affecting other dependencies.
