# Load and Performance Testing

Performance Testing is a subset of Performance Engineering. It is a process of evaluating a systemâ€™s behavior under various extreme conditions. The main intent of performance testing is to monitor and improve key performance indicators such as response time, throughput, memory, CPU utilization, and more.

There are three objectives (three S) of Performance testing to observe and evaluate: `Speed`, `Scalability` and `Stability`. Following are the commonly used performance testing types, but not limited to:

- Load Testing
- Stress Testing
- Spike Testing
- Endurance Testing
- Volume Testing
- Scalability Testing
- Capacity Testing

Load Testing is one type of performance testing. It helps to evaluate the application under tests' behaviors such as response time, throughput, pass/fail transactions, and more under the normal workload. e.g., cart checkout response time is 500 milliseconds under typical business hours.
