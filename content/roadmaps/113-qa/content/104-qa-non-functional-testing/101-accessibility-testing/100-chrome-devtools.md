# Chrome dev tools

These are a set of tools built into the browser to aid frontend developers diagnose and solve various issues in their applications — such as JavaScript and logical bugs, CSS styling issues or even just making quick temprary alterations to the DOM.

To enter the dev tools, right click and click **Inspect** (or press `ctrl+shift+c`/`cmd+opt+c`) to enter the Elements panel. Here you can debug CSS and HTML issues. If you want to see logged messages or interact with javascript, enter the **Console** tab from the tabs above (or press `ctrl+shift+j`/`cmd+opt+j` to enter it directly). Another very useful feature in the Chrome dev tools is the Lighthouse (for checking perfomance) — more on this later.

NOTE: This isn't a chrome-specific feature, and most browsers (Chromium based or otherwise) will have their own, largely-similar set of devtools.
