# Headless Testing

Headless testing is when end-to-end tests are performed without loading the browser's user interface. Since the browser operates as a typical browser would but does not make use of the user interface, it is considered highly suitable for automated testing.

A few example cases where one may use headless browser testing include:

- Automating HTML event responses, such as form submission, keyboard events, mouse-clicking, etc.
- Web scraping
- Generating screenshots of webpages
