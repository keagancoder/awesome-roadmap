# Tester Mindset

As a Quality Assurance Engineer, your job is to look for the weak spots in a product, whatever that product may be, and report them back, so that they can be fixed and thus, the product you are working on can be of the highest quality possible.

To do your job successfully, you need to have a Testing mindset. What does that mean? Among other things, it means you have to think in the most destructive way possible and be as creative as possible.

A few important points:
- Know the product you are testing
- Don’t be afraid to think outside of the box when you are testing it
- Don’t be afraid to misuse it as much as possible.
