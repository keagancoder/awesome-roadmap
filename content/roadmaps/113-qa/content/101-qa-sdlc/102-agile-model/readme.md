# Agile Model

The agile model refers to a software development approach based on iterative development. Agile methods break tasks into smaller iterations or parts that do not directly involve long-term planning. The project scope and requirements are laid down at the beginning of the development process. Plans regarding the number of iterations, the duration, and the scope of each iteration are clearly defined in advance.

The Agile software development methodology is one of the simplest and most effective processes to turn a vision for a business need into software solutions.
