During the development process, it's common to use Linux servers for issue troubleshooting. This involves navigating between different directories and viewing various log files to pinpoint the issue. This requires a large number of Linux commands, which can be lengthy and difficult to manage. To address this pain point, we developed the TLDR project, which provides an interface for easily managing Linux alias commands. This not only saves time but also minimizes the risk of errors that can occur when executing commands directly.
